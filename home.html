		<p>Hi, my name is David Madueme! I currently 20 years old, but I will be turning 21 in November 2022. I am currently a student at Columbus State Community College, and
		I'm making this website because I want to have a space where I can showcase my <a href="Introduction page.html">life experiences</a> and accomplishments to people in a creative and colorful way. The primary
		purpose of this website is to make my life story easy to access and easy to navigate through. You are currently on the homepage, but there will be 6 other pages that will
		contain important information about my life. These 6 pages are my "Introduction" page, my "Personal Interests" page, my "Places I've Traveled page", my "Academic Achievements"
		page, my "Career Goals and Aspirations" page, and my "Thanks for Visiting page." </p>
		<p>Each page will have its own set of information about my life, and you will also be able to see pictures of myself, places I've traveled, and more. I will try to make the
		descriptions on each page as engaging as possible so that viewers do not get too bored reading, haha! Another useful feature on the homepage will be the  navigation bar
		below. This section will display links to all of the various pages of my website, and that will make navigation easier for you.</p>
