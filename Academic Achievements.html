		<p>My time in college has been a mixture of being at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">OSU</a> and Columbus State. I was at OSU for one year and a semester, and I transferred to Columbus State at the 
		beginning of 2022. I took many interesting classes. Some of the classes that interested me the most during my time between these schools are English, Engineering, 
		Black History, and Intro to Programming. I took my English and Engineering classes at Ohio State, and took the other two at Columbus State. My English professor was very 
		interesting, and the class was pretty cool. We spent the semester preparing for our presentation at the end of class. However, we learned a lot about how to effectively 
		communicate ourselves through writing. We would do a lot of readings and have to submit writings about our thoughts and perspectives. We also had a lot of fun discussions. Overall, 
		I really enjoyed that class. Engineering was also an interesting class. I initially wanted to become a mechanical engineering before I switched to computer science. Although I
		didn't go into engineering, I thought this class did a great job of teaching us problem solving skills. It was great to work in groups and do labs together, and it taught us the 
		importance of dividing up work and making sure everyone did their part. Taking that class also taught me that I need to do more to make sure that I am contributing to me group. 
		My first major class at Columbus State was my Black History class, and that class really challenged many of my perspectives of being Black in the US. We learned a lot of 
		interesting things about Black history, and it really helped me feel more proud to be both African and Black. Lastly, I loved taking my Intro to Programming class this summer.
		This was actually the class that brought me back into programming. I took some coding classes at OSU but was overwhelmed by the complexity. However, we actually began learning a 
		visual programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>. Doing scratch made me realize that even the most complicated programming languages are just logic presented in a complicated syntax. I 
		learned about ways to effectively visualize coding and make it less intimidating than it seemed. Overall, it was a really beneficial class.</p>
		<p>My grades at OSU were fairly average. I had a 2.48 GPA during my Freshman year, but struggled to do well after that. I worked really hard at Columbus State and started to
		improve my grades. I got a C in my Black history class, a B in my Astronomy class, and an A in my Intro to Programming class. I began to take school more seriously after not 
		doing too well at OSU, and seeing the importance of finding a career path. I am happy to say that I made the Dean's List during the Summer 2022 semester. That semester really 
		changed a lot of things for me and improved my outlook on my future.
