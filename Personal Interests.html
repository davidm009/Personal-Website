		<p>I have many personal interests, but for the sake of time, I will list 4 personal hobbies that I enjoy. These hobbies are playing with Legos, playing videogames, 
		watching anime, and making videos for my youtube channel. I have loved playing with Legos since I was a kid. I got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego">Legos</a> at a young age and enjoyed playing with them for
		many years. I just loved the freedom that Legos give you to just plan and build whatever you want, and see your creations come alive right in front of you. I lost my Legos 
		for years, but recently I got back into them and have been loving them ever since. They really help me destress from a tough day, and it is fund to create various new creations.
		Videogames is another important aspect of my life. I've been playing games since I was a kid and I truly love them. Videogames are fun to me because many games have very fun 
		gameply elements that keep me engaged. Many games have fun fighting scenes, action sequences, and puzzles that keep me playing for hours. Some of my favorite videogame 
		franchises are Zelda, Final Fantasy, Sonic, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, LittleBigPlanet, and more.Videogames can often be a way for me to escape after a stressful day
		and experience something interesting. I love exploring new environments in games, as well as playing fun gameplay. Overall, I love videogames.</p>
		<p>Anime is something my older brothers introduced me to. Some of the popular anime I watched when I was a kid were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a> and Dragon Ball Z. I really like anime because it
		contained really deep and awesome stories that you just can't find in many cartoons. Don't get me wrong. I loved shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender as a kid. But anime really
		introduced me to really deep and intricate storytelling that you won't find in many places. Anime is cool because like superhero shows, they have awesome fight scenes and great 
		music. I also am really inspired by the main characters of anime. The final hobby I will list here is an old hobby that I might get back into. I really enjoy making videos for
		my youtube channel. It is something I began a few years ago. I really enjoyed recording sessions of me playing videogames, editing them with an intro and outro, and then posting
		them on youtube. Unfortunately, I didn't quite earn the success I hoped haha. But I am thinking of maybe getting back into this hobby if I ever build a following. Overall, all
		of these hobbies and interests mean a lot to me!</p>
