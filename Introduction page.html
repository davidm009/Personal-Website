		<p>Hey, what's up! My name is David Madueme. I'm currently 20, a junior in college, and attending Columbus State Community College. I'm grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and I 
		graduated from Columbus City Schools. I am the baby in my family, and I have 2 older brothers and 1 older sister. It was definitely tough to find me identity being the youngest.
		I spent a lot of time looking up to my older siblings for guidance. But eventually I learned about what kind of person I am and what my interests I have. My family is from 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, and my parents immigrated here in the late 90s. My parents wanted a better life for their kids, so they brought us here where we could get a great education. My
		family is Christian, and going to church is a really important part of our lives. As a person, I am pretty nerdy. My main interests are videogames and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a>. I have played videogames for most of my life, and even now I still love them. Anime are these Japanese shows that are
		really cool and interesting. I enjoy watchin new anime and discoveering new stories. I am a very introverted person, so I like to keep to myself. However, 
		I absolutely love hanging out with my friends. People might think I was an extrovert if they saw me with my friends haha.</p>
		
		<p>The primary reason I decided to make this webpage is because I actually wanted to think about my life and what I''ve accomplished. I feel like doing this will boost
		my confidence, and it may allow someone else to be inspired by my story. I think its good to list out your accomplishments and your life because it forces you to think about 
		the areas where things are going good, and the areas that may need some improvement. Overall, I think this website will be good to look back on.</p>
