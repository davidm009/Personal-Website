		<p>I've traveled to a few places. Some of the places that made a strong impression on me are Seattle, Pittsburgh, and the state of Oregon. I've visiting Seattle several
		times because that is where my oldest brother originally moved when he started his job at Amazon. He is currently living there peacefully with his family. My nephew is also
		living there and I truly love spending time with him! Seattle is a great city to visit. Of course, the Space Needle has a great view and looks amazing. You can definitely see
		much of the city from top floor there. There are also many other great places to visit in Seattle. The city is filled with various museums, parks, and resorts. Downtown Seattle has 
		a lot of great shops and tourist locations to visit. I recently visiting a musuem in Seattle that had a lot of boats and old American artifcats. It was a really nice experience.</p>
		
		<p>The second place I have traveled to is Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is the city where my 2 older brothers lived and graduated college. I visited the city several times and it is 
		great. The Carnegie Mellon University campus always looked huge and beautiful. The city of Pittsburgh is also nice too, but many of the roads are hilly haha. The city also has
		a lot of nice stores and places to visit. The last place is the state of Oregon. I actually traveled to several cities in Oregon with my brother and his family. The main reason
		we went to Oregon was to check some of their natural parks and lakes. We saw <a href="https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm">Crater Lake</a> in Oregon and it was beautiful. It had a very blue color, and it just looked very expansive
		and pretty. We took a hike down to the lake, and we were able to take some pictures right next to the lake. We also went to Portland, Oregon, and saw a public Park and a Chinese 
		museum. The Chinese museum was very beautiful. We saw a lot of artifacts at the musuem that were really cultural and interesting. They also add some of the nature from China for 
		people to see. We traveled through Portland and saw the beautiful city. It really does look amazing, and I actually feel bad about thinking that there was not much in Oregon before 
		haha. Overall, I really enjoyed my visits to Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Oregon.</p>
