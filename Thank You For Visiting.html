		<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my website. The primary purpose of this website was to create an outline of what I have accomplished so far and <a href="Career Goals and Aspirations.html">where
		I want to go in life</a>. I want to look back on my accomplishments as a college student as I get ready to graduate in a few years. I went through a lot of struggles over the past 
		year and struggled to find purpose, but I think my time at Columbus State has really helped me to find purpose and direction. I hope this page inspired you to follow your dreams
		even when it's touch. Achieving success is not easy, but it's totatlly worth it.</p>
		
		<p>I will leave you with this famous quote by Kobe Bryant(May he Rest In Peace): "I have nothing
		in common with lazy people who blame others for their lack of success. Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses." Thank you for taking the time to visit my 
		page and good luck with your journey!</p>
