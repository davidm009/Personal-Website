		<p>For this page, let me start by listing out some people that inspire me. I am strongly inspired by Kobe Bryant, Bill Gates, and Barack Obama. I am inspired by Bill Gates 
		because of how hard he worked to build Microsoft and how amazing Windows can be. I look up to Obama because he is very charismatic, has strong leadership skills, and he proves
		that anyone can achieve great things if they set their mind to it. I am strongly inspired by Kobe Bryant because he proved that hard work and perseverance can achieve great 
		things. My main career goal is to go into software development, and I am particularily interested in becoming a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/">web  developer</a>. I think web development would be good for me 
		because I am a very <a href="Academic Achievements.html">visual person</a>, and you can clearly see how your code is effecting a web page with web development. I think programming is a good career path for me 
		because I have always been a logical person, and the logical steps to programming have always been easy for me to grasp. I am also hoping to get a programming internship 
		soon.</p>
		
		
		<p>Some companies that I would be interested in working at are Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. I find all of these companies interesting because they all have really affected
		the technology we use everyday. I also think working for companies like Google or Amazon would be nice.</p>
